<h2><a name="BIOGRAPHICAL_PREFACE" id="BIOGRAPHICAL_PREFACE"></a>BIOGRAPHICAL PREFACE</h2>

<p class="bio">EDWARD FITZGERALD</p>


<p>Edward Fitzgerald, whom the world has already
learned, in spite of his own efforts to remain
within the shadow of anonymity, to look upon as
one of the rarest poets of the last century, was
born at Bredfield, in Suffolk, on the 31st March,
1809. He was the third son of John Purcell, of
Kilkenny, in Ireland, who, marrying Miss Mary
Frances Fitzgerald, daughter of John Fitzgerald,
of Williamstown, County Waterford, added that
distinguished name to his own patronymic; and the
future Omar was thus doubly of Irish extraction.
(Both the families of Purcell and Fitzgerald claim
descent from Norman warriors of the eleventh
century.) This circumstance is thought to have
had some influence in attracting him to the study
of Persian poetry, Iran and Erin being almost convertible
terms in the early days of modern ethnology.
After some years of primary education at the
grammar school of Bury St. Edmunds, he entered
Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1826, and there
formed acquaintance with several young men of
great abilities, most of whom rose to distinction
before him, but never ceased to regard with affectionate
remembrance the quiet and amiable
associate of their college-days. Amongst them were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>Alfred Tennyson, James Spedding, William Bodham
Donne, John Mitchell Kemble, and William
Makepeace Thackeray; and their long friendship
was touchingly referred to by Tennyson in dedicating
his last poem to the memory of Edward
Fitzgerald. "Euphranor," our author's earliest
printed work, affords a curious picture of his
academic life and associations. Its substantial reality
is evident beneath the thin disguise of the symbolical
or classical names which he gives to the personages
of the colloquy; and the speeches which he
puts into his own mouth are full of the humorous
gravity, and whimsical and kindly philosophy,
which remained his distinguishing characteristics
till the end. This book was first published in 1851;
a second and a third edition were printed some
years later; all anonymous, and each of the latter
two differing from its predecessor by changes in
the text which were not indicated on the title-pages.</p>

<p>"Euphranor" furnishes a good many characterizations
which would be useful for any writer treating
upon Cambridge society in the third decade of
this century. Kenelm Digby, the author of the
"Broadstone of Honour," had left Cambridge before
the time when Euphranor held his "dialogue,"
but he is picturesquely recollected as "a grand
swarthy fellow who might have stepped out of the
canvas of some knightly portrait in his father's
hall&mdash;perhaps the living image of one sleeping under
some cross-legged <i>effigies</i> in the church." In
"Euphranor," it is easy to discover the earliest phase
of the unconquerable attachment which Fitzgerald
entertained for his college and his life-long friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and which induced him in later days to make frequent
visits to Cambridge, renewing and refreshing
the old ties of custom and friendship. In fact, his
disposition was affectionate to a fault, and he betrayed
his consciousness of weakness in that respect
by referring playfully at times to "a certain natural
lubricity" which he attributed to the Irish character,
and professed to discover especially in himself.
This amiability of temper endeared him to
many friends of totally dissimilar tastes and qualities;
and, by enlarging his sympathies, enabled him
to enjoy the fructifying influence of studies pursued
in communion with scholars more profound
than himself, but less gifted with the power of expression.
One of the younger Cambridge men with
whom he became intimate during his periodical
pilgrimages to the university, was Edward B.
Cowell, a man of the highest attainment in Oriental
learning, who resembled Fitzgerald himself in
the possession of a warm and genial heart and the
most unobtrusive modesty. From Cowell he could
easily learn that the hypothetical affinity between
the names of Erin and Iran belonged to an obsolete
stage of etymology; but the attraction of a far-fetched
theory was replaced by the charm of reading
Persian poetry in companionship with his
young friend, who was equally competent to enjoy
and to analyze the beauties of a literature that
formed a portion of his regular studies. They read
together the poetical remains of Khayyám&mdash;a
choice of reading which sufficiently indicates the
depth and range of Mr. Cowell's knowledge.
Omar Khayyám, although not quite forgotten, enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
in the history of Persian literature a celebrity
like that of Occleve and Gower in our own. In the
many <i>Tazkirát</i> (memoirs or memorials) of Poets,
he was mentioned and quoted with esteem; but his
poems, laboring as they did under the original sin of
heresy and atheism, were seldom looked at, and, from
lack of demand on the part of readers, had become
rarer than those of most other writers since the days
of Firdausi. European scholars knew little of his
works beyond his Arabic treatise on Algebra, and
Mr. Cowell may be said to have disentombed his
poems from oblivion. Now, thanks to the fine
taste of that scholar, and to the transmuting genius
of Fitzgerald, no Persian poet is so well known in
the western world as Abu-'l-fat'h 'Omar, son of
Ibrahim the tentmaker of Naishápúr, whose manhood
synchronizes with the Norman conquest of
England, and who took for his poetic name (<i>takhallus</i>)
the designation of his father's trade
(<i>Khayyám</i>). The "Rubá'iyyát" (Quatrains) do
not compose a single poem divided into a certain
number of stanzas; there is no continuity of plan
in them, and each stanza is a distinct thought expressed
in musical verse. There is no other element
of unity in them than the general tendency of the
Epicurean idea, and the arbitrary divan form by
which they are grouped according to the alphabetical
arrangement of the final letters; those in
which the rhymes end in <i>a</i> constituting the first
division, those with <i>b</i> the second, and so on. The
peculiar attitude towards religion and the old questions
of fate, immortality, the origin and the
destiny of man, which educated thinkers have assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
in the present age of Christendom, is found
admirably foreshadowed in the fantastic verses of
Khayyám, who was no more of a Mohammedan
than many of our best writers are Christians. His
philosophical and Horatian fancies&mdash;graced as they
are by the charms of a lyrical expression equal to
that of Horace, and a vivid brilliance of imagination
to which the Roman poet could make no
claim&mdash;exercised a powerful influence upon Fitzgerald's
mind, and colored his thoughts to such a
degree that even when he oversteps the largest
license allowed to a translator, his phrases reproduce
the spirit and manner of his original with a
nearer approach to perfection than would appear
possible. It is usually supposed that there is more
of Fitzgerald than of Khayyám in the English
"Rubá'iyyát," and that the old Persian simply afforded
themes for the Anglo-Irishman's display
of poetic power; but nothing could be further
from the truth. The French translator, J. B.
Nicolas, and the English one, Mr. Whinfield, supply
a closer mechanical reflection of the sense in each
separate stanza; but Mr. Fitzgerald has, in some
instances, given a version equally close and exact;
in others, rejointed scattered phrases from more
than one stanza of his original, and thus accomplished
a feat of marvelous poetical transfusion.
He frequently turns literally into English the
strange outlandish imagery which Mr. Whinfield
thought necessary to replace by more intelligible
banalities, and in this way the magic of his genius
has successfully transplanted into the garden of
English poesy exotics that bloom like native flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>One of Mr. Fitzgerald's Woodbridge friends was
Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet, with whom he
maintained for many years the most intimate and
cordial intercourse, and whose daughter Lucy he
married. He wrote the memoir of his friend's life
which appeared in the posthumous volume of
Barton's poems. The story of his married life was
a short one. With all the overflowing amiability
of his nature, there were mingled certain peculiarities
or waywardnesses which were more suitable
to the freedom of celibacy than to the staidness of
matrimonial life. A separation took place by
mutual agreement, and Fitzgerald behaved in this
circumstance with the generosity and unselfishness
which were apparent in all his whims no less than
in his more deliberate actions. Indeed, his entire
career was marked by an unchanging goodness of
heart and a genial kindliness; and no one could
complain of having ever endured hurt or ill-treatment
at his hands. His pleasures were innocent
and simple. Amongst the more delightful, he
counted the short coasting trips, occupying no
more than a day or two at a time, which he used
to make in his own yacht from Lowestoft, accompanied
only by a crew of two men, and such a
friend as Cowell, with a large pasty and a few
bottles of wine to supply their material wants. It
is needless to say that books were also put into the
cabin, and that the symposia of the friends were
thus brightened by communion with the minds of
the great departed. Fitzgerald's enjoyment of
gnomic wisdom enshrined in words of exquisite
propriety was evinced by the frequency with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
which he used to read Montaigne's essays and
Madame de Sévigné's letters, and the various works
from which he extracted and published his collection
of wise saws entitled "Polonius." This
taste was allied to a love for what was classical and
correct in literature, by which he was also enabled
to appreciate the prim and formal muse of Crabbe,
in whose grandson's house he died.</p>

<p>His second printed work was the "Polonius," already
referred to, which appeared in 1852. It
exemplifies his favorite reading, being a collection
of extracts, sometimes short proverbial phrases,
sometimes longer pieces of characterization or reflection,
arranged under abstract headings. He
occasionally quotes Dr. Johnson, for whom he entertains
sincere admiration; but the ponderous and
artificial fabric of Johnsonese did not please him
like the language of Bacon, Fuller, Sir Thomas
Browne, Coleridge, whom he cites frequently. A
disproportionate abundance of wise words was
drawn from Carlyle; his original views, his forcible
sense, and the friendship with which Fitzgerald
regarded him, having apparently blinded the latter
to the ungainly style and ungraceful mannerisms
of the Chelsea sage. (It was Thackeray who first
made them personally acquainted; and Fitzgerald
remained always loyal to his first instincts of affection
and admiration.) Polonius also marks the
period of his earliest attention to Persian studies,
as he quotes in it the great Súfi poet, Jalál-ud-dín-Rúmi,
whose "Masnavi" has been translated into
English by Mr. Redhouse, but whom Fitzgerald
can only have seen in the original. He, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
spells the name <i>Jallaladin</i>, an incorrect form of
which he could not have been guilty at the time
when he produced Omar Khayyám, and which
thus betrays that he had not long been engaged
with Irani literature. He was very fond of Montaigne's
essays, and of Pascal's "Pensées"; but his
"Polonius" reveals a sort of dislike and contempt
for Voltaire. Amongst the Germans, Jean Paul,
Goethe, Alexander von Humboldt and August
Wilhelm von Schlegel attracted him greatly; but
he seems to have read little German, and probably
only quoted translations. His favorite motto was
"Plain Living and High Thinking," and he expresses
great reverence for all things manly, simple,
and true. The laws and institutions of England
were, in his eyes, of the highest value and sacredness;
and whatever Irish sympathies he had would
never have diverted his affections from the Union
to Home Rule. This is strongly illustrated by
some original lines of blank verse at the end of
"Polonius," annexed to his quotation, under "Æsthetics,"
of the words in which Lord Palmerston
eulogized Mr. Gladstone for having devoted his
Neapolitan tour to an inspection of the prisons.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald's next printed work was a translation
of Six Dramas of Calderon, published in 1853,
which was unfavorably received at the time, and
consequently withdrawn by him from circulation.
His name appeared on the title-page,&mdash;a concession
to publicity which was so unusual with him that
it must have been made under strong pressure from
his friends. The book is in nervous blank verse, a
mode of composition which he handled with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
ease and skill. There is no waste of power in diffuseness
and no employment of unnecessary
epithets. It gives the impression of a work of the
Shakespearean age, and reveals a kindred felicity,
strength, and directness of language. It deserves
to rank with his best efforts in poetry, but its ill-success
made him feel that the publication of his
name was an unfavorable experiment, and he never
again repeated it. His great modesty, however,
would sufficiently account for his shyness. Of
"Omar Khayyám," even after the little book had
won its way to general esteem, he used to say that
the suggested addition of his name on the title
would imply an assumption of importance which
he considered that his "transmogrification" of the
Persian poet did not possess.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald's conception of a translator's privilege
is well set forth in the prefaces of his versions from
Calderon, and the "Agamemnon" of Æschylus.
He maintained that, in the absence of the perfect
poet, who shall re-create in his own language the
body and soul of his original, the best system is
that of a paraphrase conserving the spirit of the
author,&mdash;a sort of literary metempsychosis. Calderon,
Æschylus, and Omar Khayyám were all
treated with equal license, so far as form is concerned,&mdash;the
last, perhaps, the most arbitrarily;
but the result is not unsatisfactory as having given
us perfect English poems instinct with the true
flavor of their prototypes. The Persian was probably
somewhat more Horatian and less melancholy,
the Greek a little less florid and mystic, the
Spaniard more lyrical and fluent, than their metaphrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
has made them; but the essential spirit has
not escaped in transfusion. Only a man of singular
gifts could have performed the achievement, and
these works attest Mr. Fitzgerald's right to rank
amongst the finest poets of the century. About
the same time as he printed his Calderon, another
set of translations from the same dramatist was
published by the late D. F. MacCarthy, a scholar
whose acquaintance with Castilian literature was
much deeper than Mr. Fitzgerald's, and who also
possessed poetical abilities of no mean order, with
a totally different sense of the translator's duty.
The popularity of MacCarthy's versions has been
considerable, and as an equivalent rendering of the
original in sense and form his work is valuable.
Spaniards familiar with the English language rate
its merit highly; but there can be little question
of the very great superiority of Mr. Fitzgerald's
work as a contribution to English literature. It is
indeed only from this point of view that we should
regard all the literary labors of our author. They
are English poetical work of fine quality, dashed
with a pleasant outlandish flavor which heightens
their charm; and it is as English poems, not as
translations, that they have endeared themselves
even more to the American English than to the
mixed Britons of England.</p>

<p>It was an occasion of no small moment to Mr.
Fitzgerald's fame, and to the intellectual gratification
of many thousands of readers, when he took
his little packet of "Rubá'iyyát" to Mr. Quaritch
in the latter part of the year 1858. It was printed
as a small quarto pamphlet, bearing the publisher's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
name but not the author's; and although apparently
a complete failure at first,&mdash;a failure which Mr.
Fitzgerald regretted less on his own account than
on that of his publisher, to whom he had generously
made a present of the book,&mdash;received, nevertheless,
a sufficient distribution by being quickly reduced
from the price of five shillings and placed
in the box of cheap books marked a penny each.
Thus forced into circulation, the two hundred
copies which had been printed were soon exhausted.
Among the buyers were Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
Swinburne, Sir Richard Burton, and William
Simpson, the accomplished artist of the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>. The influence exercised by the first
three, especially by Rossetti, upon a clique of young
men who later grew to distinction, was sufficient
to attract observation to the singular beauties of
the poem anonymously translated from the Persian.
Most readers had no possible opportunity of discovering
whether it was a disguised original or an
actual translation;&mdash;even Burton enjoyed probably
but little chance of seeing a manuscript of the
Persian "Rubá'iyyát." The Oriental imagery and
allusions were too thickly scattered throughout
the verses to favor the notion that they could be
the original work of an Englishman; yet it was
shrewdly suspected by most of the appreciative
readers that the "translator" was substantially the
author and creator of the poem. In the refuge
of his anonymity, Fitzgerald derived an innocent
gratification from the curiosity that was aroused
on all sides. After the first edition had disappeared,
inquiries for the little book became frequent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
and in the year 1868 he gave the MS. of
his second edition to Mr. Quaritch, and the "Rubá'iyyát"
came into circulation once more, but with
several alterations and additions by which the number
of stanzas was somewhat increased beyond the
original seventy-five. Most of the changes were,
as might have been expected, improvements; but
in some instances the author's taste or caprice was
at fault,&mdash;notably in the first <i>Rubá'iy</i>. His fastidious
desire to avoid anything that seemed
<i>baroque</i> or unnatural or appeared like plagiarism,
may have influenced him; but it was probably because
he had already used the idea in his rendering
of Jámí's "Salámán," that he sacrificed a fine and
novel piece of imagery in his first stanza and replaced
it by one of much more ordinary character.
If it were from a dislike to pervert his original too
largely, he had no need to be so scrupulous, since
he dealt on the whole with the "Rubá'iyyát" as
though he had the license of absolute authorship,
changing, transposing, and manipulating the substance
of the Persian quatrains with a singular freedom.
The vogue of "old Omar" (as he would affectionately
call his work) went on increasing, and
American readers took it up with eagerness. In
those days the mere mention of Omar Khayyám
between two strangers meeting fortuitously acted
like a sign of freemasonry and established frequently
a bond of friendship. Some curious instances
of this have been related. A remarkable
feature of the Omar-cult in the United States was
the circumstance that single individuals bought
numbers of copies for gratuitous distribution before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the book was reprinted in America. Its
editions have been relatively numerous, when we
consider how restricted was the circle of readers
who could understand the peculiar beauties of the
work. A third edition appeared in 1872, with
some further alterations, and may be regarded as
virtually the author's final revision, for it hardly
differs at all from the text of the fourth edition,
which appeared in 1879. This last formed the first
portion of a volume entitled "Rubáiyát of Omar
Khayyám; and the Salámán and Absál of Jámí;
rendered into English verse." The "Salámán"
(which had already been printed in separate form
in 1856) is a poem chiefly in blank verse, interspersed
with various meters (although it is all in
one measure in the original) embodying a love-story
of mystic significance; for Jámí was, unlike
Omar Khayyám, a true Súfi, and indeed differed
in other respects, his celebrity as a pious Mussulman
doctor being equal to his fame as a poet. He
lived in the fifteenth century, in a period of literary
brilliance and decay; and the rich exuberance of
his poetry, full of far-fetched conceits, involved expressions,
overstrained imagery, and false taste,
offers a strong contrast to the simpler and more
forcible language of Khayyám. There is little use
of Arabic in the earlier poet; he preferred the vernacular
speech to the mongrel language which was
fashionable among the heirs of the Saracen conquerors;
but Jámí's composition is largely embroidered
with Arabic.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzgerald had from his early days been
thrown into contact with the Crabbe family; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
Reverend George Crabbe (the poet's grandson)
was an intimate friend of his, and it was on a visit
to Morton Rectory that Fitzgerald died. As we
know that friendship has power to warp the judgment,
we shall not probably be wrong in supposing
that his enthusiastic admiration for Crabbe's poems
was not the product of sound, impartial criticism.
He attempted to reintroduce them to the world by
publishing a little volume of "Readings from
Crabbe," produced in the last year of his life, but
without success. A different fate awaited his
"Agamemnon: a tragedy taken from Æschylus,"
which was first printed privately by him, and
afterwards published with alterations in 1876. It
is a very free rendering from the Greek, and full
of a poetical beauty which is but partly assignable
to Æschylus. Without attaining to anything like
the celebrity and admiration which have followed
Omar Khayyám, the "Agamemnon" has achieved
much more than a <i>succès d'estime</i>. Mr. Fitzgerald's
renderings from the Greek were not confined
to this one essay; he also translated the two
&OElig;dipus dramas of Sophocles, but left them unfinished
in manuscript till Prof. Eliot Norton had
a sight of them and urged him to complete his
work. When this was done, he had them set in
type, but only a very few proofs can have been
struck off, as it seems that, at least in England, no
more than one or two copies were sent out by the
author. In a similar way he printed translations
of two of Calderon's plays not included in the published
"Six Dramas"&mdash;namely, "La Vida es Sueño,"
and "El Magico Prodigioso" (both ranking among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
the Spaniard's finest work); but they also were
withheld from the public and all but half a dozen
friends.</p>

<p>When his old boatman died, he abandoned his
nautical exercises and gave up his yacht forever.
During the last few years of his life, he divided
his time between Cambridge, Crabbe's house, and
his own home at Little Grange, near Woodbridge,
where he received occasional visits from friends and
relatives. He was one of the most modest men who
have enriched English literature with poetry of
distinct and permanent value, and his best epitaph
is found in Tennyson's "Tiresias and other Poems,"
published immediately after our author's quiet exit
from life, in 1883, in the seventy-fifth year of
his age.</p>

<h2><a name="OMAR_KHAYYAM" id="OMAR_KHAYYAM"></a>OMAR KHAYYÁM</h2>

<p class="bio"><i>The Astronomer-Poet of Persia</i></p>

<p class="bio">(BY EDWARD FITZGERALD)</p>


<p>Omar Khayyám was born at Naishápúr in Khorassán
in the latter half of our Eleventh, and died
within the First Quarter of our Twelfth Century.
The slender story of his life is curiously twined
about that of two other very considerable Figures
in their Time and Country: one of whom tells the
Story of all Three. This was Nizám ul Mulk,
Vizyr to Alp Arslan the Son, and Malik Shah the
Grandson, of Toghrul Beg the Tartar, who had
wrested Persia from the feeble Successor of
Mahmúd the Great, and founded that Seljukian
Dynasty which finally roused Europe into the
Crusades. This Nizám ul Mulk, in his <i>Wasiyat</i>&mdash;or
<i>Testament</i>&mdash;which he wrote and left as a
Memorial for future Statesmen&mdash;relates the following,
as quoted in the <i>Calcutta Review</i>, No. 59,
from Mirkhond's History of the Assassins.</p>

<p>"One of the greatest of the wise men of
Khorassán was the Imám Mowaffak of Naishápúr,
a man highly honored and reverenced,&mdash;may God
rejoice his soul: his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five,
and it was the universal belief that every boy
who read the Koran or studied the traditions in his
presence, would assuredly attain to honor and happiness.
For this cause did my father send me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Tús to Naishápúr with Abd-us-samad, the doctor
of law, that I might employ myself in study and
learning under the guidance of that illustrious
teacher. Towards me he ever turned an eye of
favor and kindness, and as his pupil I felt for him
extreme affection and devotion, so that I passed
four years in his service. When I first came there,
I found two other pupils of mine own age newly
arrived, Hakim Omar Khayyám, and the ill-fated
Ben Sabbáh. Both were endowed with sharpness
of wit and the highest natural powers; and we three
formed a close friendship together. When the
Imám rose from his lectures, they used to join me,
and we repeated to each other the lessons we had
heard. Now Omar was a native of Naishápúr,
while Hasan Ben Sabbáh's father was one Ali, a
man of austere life and practice, but heretical in
his creed and doctrine. One day Hasan said to
me and to Khayyám, 'It is a universal belief that
the pupils of the Imám Mowaffak will attain to
fortune. Now, even if we <i>all</i> do not attain thereto,
without doubt one of us will; what then shall be
our mutual pledge and bond?' We answered,
'Be it what you please.' 'Well,' he said, let us
make a vow, that to whomsoever this fortune falls,
he shall share it equally with the rest, and reserve
no pre-eminence for himself.' 'Be it so,' we both
replied, and on those terms we mutually pledged
our words. Years rolled on, and I went from
Khorassán to Transoxiana and wandered to Ghazni
and Cabul; and when I returned, I was invested
with office, and rose to be administrator of affairs
during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp Arslan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>"He goes on to state, that years passed by, and
both his old school-friends found him out, and
came and claimed a share in his good fortune, according
to the school-day vow. The Vizier was
generous and kept his word. Hasan demanded a
place in the government, which the Sultan granted
at the Vizier's request; but discontented with a
gradual rise, he plunged into the maze of intrigue
of an oriental court, and, failing in a base attempt
to supplant his benefactor, he was disgraced and
fell. After many mishaps and wanderings, Hasan
became the head of the Persian sect of the
<i>Ismailians</i>,&mdash;a party of fanatics who had long
murmured in obscurity, but rose to an evil eminence
under the guidance of his strong and evil
will. In <span class="txt90">A.D.</span> 1090, he seized the castle of Alamút,
in the province of Rúdbar, which lies in the mountainous
tract south of the Caspian Sea; and it was
from this mountain home he obtained that evil
celebrity among the Crusaders as the <span class="smcap">Old Man
of the Mountains</span>, and spread terror through
the Mohammedan world; and it is yet disputed
whether the word <i>Assassin</i>, which they have left
in the language of modern Europe as their dark
memorial, is derived from the <i>hashish</i>, or opiate of
hemp-leaves (the Indian <i>bhang</i>), with which they
maddened themselves to the sullen pitch of oriental
desperation, or from the name of the founder
of the dynasty, whom we have seen in his quiet
collegiate days, at Naishápúr. One of the countless
victims of the Assassin's dagger was Nizám-ul-Mulk
himself, the old schoolboy friend.</p>

<p>"Omar Khayyám also came to the Vizier to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
claim his share; but not to ask for title or office.
'The greatest boon you can confer on me,' he said,
'is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of
your fortune, to spread wide the advantages of
Science, and pray for your long life and prosperity.'
The Vizier tells us, that when he found Omar was
really sincere in his refusal, he pressed him no further,
but granted him a yearly pension of 1200
<i>mithkáls</i> of gold from the treasury of Naishápúr.</p>

<p>"At Naishápúr thus lived and died Omar Khayyám,
'busied,' adds the Vizier, 'in winning knowledge
of every kind, and especially in Astronomy,
wherein he attained to a very high pre-eminence.
Under the Sultanate of Malik Shah, he came to
Merv, and obtained great praise for his proficiency
in science, and the Sultan showered favors upon
him.'</p>

<p>"When the Malik Shah determined to reform the
calendar, Omar was one of the eight learned men
employed to do it; the result was the <i>Jaláli</i> era (so
called from <i>Jalál-ud-din</i>, one of the King's names)&mdash;'a
computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which
surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy
of the Gregorian style.' He is also the author of
some astronomical tables, entitled Zíji-Maliksháhí,"
and the French have lately republished and translated
an Arabic Treatise of his on Algebra.</p>

<p>"His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayyám)
signifies a Tent-maker, and he is said to have at
one time exercised that trade, perhaps before
Nizám-ul-Mulk's generosity raised him to independence.
Many Persian poets similarly derive
their names from their occupations; thus we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
Attár, 'a druggist,' Assár, 'an oil presser,' etc.
Omar himself alludes to his name in the following
whimsical lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"'Khayyám, who stitched the tents of science,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"We have only one more anecdote to give of his
Life, and that relates to the close; it is told in the
anonymous preface which is sometimes prefixed to
his poems; it has been printed in the Persian in the
Appendix to Hyde's <i>Veterum Persarum Religio</i>,
p. 499; and D'Herbelot alludes to it in his Bibliothèque,
under <i>Khiam</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is written in the chronicles of the ancients
that this King of the Wise, Omar Khayyám, died
at Naishápúr in the year of the Hegira, 517 (<span class="txt90">A.D.</span>
1123); in science he was unrivaled,&mdash;the very
paragon of his age. Khwájah Nizámi of Samarcand,
who was one of his pupils, relates the following
story: 'I often used to hold conversations with
my teacher, Omar Khayyám, in a garden; and one
day he said to me, "My tomb shall be in a spot
where the north wind may scatter roses over it." I
wondered at the words he spake, but I knew that
his were no idle words. Years after, when I
chanced to revisit Naishápúr, I went to his final
resting-place, and lo! it was just outside a garden,
and trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
over the garden wall, and dropped their flowers
upon his tomb, so that the stone was hidden under
them.'"</p></div>

<p>Thus far&mdash;without fear of Trespass&mdash;from the
<i>Calcutta Review</i>. The writer of it, on reading in
India this story of Omar's Grave, was reminded,
he says, of Cicero's account of finding Archimedes'
Tomb at Syracuse, buried in grass and weeds. I
think Thorwaldsen desired to have roses grow over
him; a wish religiously fulfilled for him to the
present day, I believe. However, to return to
Omar.</p>

<p>Though the Sultan "shower'd Favors upon him,"
Omar's Epicurean Audacity of Thought and
Speech caused him to be regarded askance in his
own Time and Country. He is said to have been
especially hated and dreaded by the Súfis, whose
Practise he ridiculed, and whose Faith amounts to
little more than his own, when stript of the Mysticism
and formal recognition of Islamism under
which Omar would not hide. Their Poets, including
Háfiz, who are (with the exception of Firdausi)
the most considerable in Persia, borrowed
largely, indeed, of Omar's material, but turning it
to a mystical Use more convenient to Themselves
and the People they addressed; a People quite as
quick of Doubt as of Belief; as keen of Bodily
Sense as of Intellectual; and delighting in a cloudy
composition of both, in which they could float
luxuriously between Heaven and Earth, and this
World and the next, on the wings of a poetical expression,
that might serve indifferently for either.
Omar was too honest of Heart as well of Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
for this. Having failed (however mistakenly) of
finding any Providence but Destiny, and any
World but This, he set about making the most of
it; preferring rather to soothe the Soul through the
Senses into Acquiescence with Things as he saw
them, than to perplex it with vain disquietude after
what they <i>might</i> be. It has been seen, however,
that his Worldly Ambition was not exorbitant; and
he very likely takes a humorous or perverse pleasure
in exalting the gratification of Sense above that
of the Intellect, in which he must have taken great
delight, although it failed to answer the Questions
in which he, in common with all men, was most
vitally interested.</p>

<p>For whatever Reason, however, Omar, as before
said, has never been popular in his own Country,
and therefore has been but scantily transmitted
abroad. The MSS. of his Poems, mutilated beyond
the average Casualties of Oriental Transcription,
are so rare in the East as scarce to have reached
Westward at all, in spite of all the acquisitions of
Arms and Science. There is no copy at the India
House, none at the Bibliothèque Nationale of
Paris. We know but one in England: No. 140 of
the Ouseley MSS. at the Bodleian, written at
Shiráz, <span class="txt90">A.D.</span> 1460. This contains but 158 Rubáiyát.
One in the Asiatic Society's Library at
Calcutta (of which we have a copy) contains
(and yet incomplete) 516, though swelled to that
by all kinds of Repetition and Corruption. So
Von Hammer speaks of <i>his</i> Copy as containing
about 200, while Dr. Sprenger catalogues the
Lucknow MSS. at double that number. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
Scribes, too, of the Oxford and Calcutta MSS. seem
to do their Work under a sort of Protest; each beginning
with a Tetrastich (whether genuine or
not) taken out of its alphabetical order; the Oxford
with one of Apology; the Calcutta with one
of Expostulation, supposed (says a Notice prefixed
to the MS.) to have arisen from a Dream, in which
Omar's mother asked about his future fate. It
may be rendered thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Oh Thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How long be crying, 'Mercy on them, God!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, who art Thou to teach, and He to learn?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Bodleian Quatrain pleads Pantheism by way
of Justification.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If I myself upon a looser Creed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have loosely strung the Jewel of Good deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let this one thing for my Atonement plead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That One for Two I never did misread."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Reviewer to whom I owe the Particulars
of Omar's Life concludes his Review by comparing
him with Lucretius, both as to natural Temper and
Genius, and as acted upon by the Circumstances
in which he lived. Both indeed were men of subtle,
strong, and cultivated Intellect, fine Imagination,
and Hearts passionate for Truth and Justice; who
justly revolted from their Country's false Religion,
and false, or foolish, Devotion to it; but who fell
short of replacing what they subverted by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
better <i>Hope</i> as others, with no better Revelation to
guide them, had yet made a Law to themselves.
Lucretius indeed, with such material as Epicurus
furnished, satisfied himself with the theory of a
vast machine fortuitously constructed and acting
by a Law that implied no Legislator; and so composing
himself into a Stoical rather than Epicurean
severity of Attitude, sat down to contemplate the
mechanical Drama of the Universe which he was
part Actor in; himself and all about him (as in
his own sublime description of the Roman Theatre)
discolored with the lurid reflex of the Curtain
suspended between the Spectator and the Sun.
Omar, more desperate, or more careless of any so
complicated System as resulted in nothing but
hopeless Necessity, flung his own Genius and
Learning with a bitter or humorous jest into the
general Ruin which their insufficient glimpses only
served to reveal; and, pretending sensual pleasure,
as the serious purpose of Life, only <i>diverted</i> himself
with speculative problems of Deity, Destiny,
Matter and Spirit, Good and Evil, and other such
questions, easier to start than to run down, and
the pursuit of which becomes a very weary sport
at last!</p>

<p>With regard to the present Translation. The
original Rubáiyát (as, missing an Arabic Guttural,
these <i>Tetrastichs</i> are more musically called) are independent
Stanzas, consisting each of four Lines
of equal though varied Prosody; sometimes <i>all</i>
rhyming, but oftener (as here imitated) the third
line a blank. Somewhat as in the Greek Alcaic,
where the penultimate line seems to lift and suspend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
the Wave that falls over in the last. As usual
with such kind of Oriental Verse, the Rubáiyát
follow one another according to Alphabetic Rhyme&mdash;a
strange succession of Grave and Gay. Those
here selected are strung into something of an
Eclogue, with perhaps a less than equal proportion
of the "Drink and make-merry," which (genuine
or not) recurs over-frequently in the Original.
Either way, the Result is sad enough: saddest perhaps
when most ostentatiously merry: more apt to
move Sorrow than Anger toward the old Tent-maker,
who, after vainly endeavoring to unshackle
his Steps from Destiny, and to catch some authentic
Glimpse of To-morrow, fell back upon To-day
(which has outlasted so many To-morrows!)
as the only ground he had got to stand upon, however
momentarily slipping from under his feet.</p>

<hr />

<p>While the second Edition of this version of
Omar was preparing, Monsieur Nicolas, French
Consul at Resht, published a very careful and very
good Edition of the Text from a lithograph copy
at Teheran, comprising 464 Rubáiyát, with translation
and notes of his own.</p>

<p>Mons. Nicolas, whose Edition has reminded me
of several things, and instructed me in others, does
not consider Omar to be the material Epicurean
that I have literally taken him for, but a Mystic,
shadowing the Deity under the figure of Wine,
Wine-bearer, etc., as Háfiz is supposed to do; in
short, a Súfi Poet like Háfiz and the rest.</p>

<p>I cannot see reason to alter my opinion, formed
as it was more than a dozen years ago when Omar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
was first shown me by one to whom I am indebted
for all I know of Oriental, and very much of other,
literature. He admired Omar's genius so much
that he would gladly have adopted any such interpretation
of his meaning as Mons. Nicolas' if
he could. That he could not, appears by his Paper
in the <i>Calcutta Review</i> already so largely quoted;
in which he argues from the Poems themselves, as
well as from what records remain of the Poet's Life.</p>

<p>And if more were needed to disprove Mons.
Nicolas' Theory, there is the Biographical Notice
which he himself has drawn up in direct contradiction
to the Interpretation of the Poems given in
his Notes. (See pp. xiii-xiv of his Preface.) Indeed
I hardly knew poor Omar was so far gone till
his Apologist informed me. For here we see that,
whatever were the Wine that Háfiz drank and
sang, the veritable Juice of the Grape it was which
Omar used, not only when carousing with his
friends, but (says Mons. Nicolas) in order to excite
himself to that pitch of Devotion which others
reached by cries and "Hurlemens." And yet,
whenever Wine, Wine-bearer, etc., occur in the
text&mdash;which is often enough&mdash;Mons. Nicolas carefully
annotates "Dieu," "La Divinité," etc.: so
carefully indeed that one is tempted to think that
he was indoctrinated by the Súfi with whom he
read the Poems. A Persian would naturally wish
to vindicate a distinguished Countryman; and a
Súfi to enrol him in his own sect, which already
comprises all the chief Poets of Persia.</p>

<p>What historical Authority has Mons. Nicolas to
show that Omar gave himself up "avec passion à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
l'étude de la philosophie des Soufis?" (Preface,
p. xiii.) The Doctrines of Pantheism, Materialism,
Necessity, etc., were not peculiar to the Súfi; nor
to Lucretius before them; nor to Epicurus before
him; probably the very original Irreligion of
Thinking men from the first; and very likely to
be the spontaneous growth of a Philosopher living
in an Age of social and political barbarism, under
shadow of one of the Two and Seventy Religions
supposed to divide the world. Von Hammer (according
to Sprenger's Oriental Catalogue) speaks
of Omar as "a Free-thinker, and <i>a great opponent
of Sufism</i>;" perhaps because, while holding much
of their Doctrine, he would not pretend to any inconsistent
severity of morals. Sir W. Ouseley has
written a note to something of the same effect on
the fly-leaf of the Bodleian MS. And in two Rubáiyát
of Mons. Nicolas' own Edition Súf and Súfi
are both disparagingly named.</p>

<p>No doubt many of these Quatrains seem unaccountable
unless mystically interpreted; but many
more as unaccountable unless literally. Were the
Wine spiritual, for instance, how wash the Body
with it when dead! Why make cups of the dead
clay to be filled with&mdash;"La Divinité"&mdash;by some
succeeding Mystic? Mons. Nicolas himself is
puzzled by some "bizarres and trop Orientals" allusions
and images&mdash;"d'une sensualité quelquefois
révoltante" indeed&mdash;which "les convenances" do
not permit him to translate, but still which the
reader cannot but refer to "La Divinité." No
doubt also many of the Quatrains in the Teheran,
as in the Calcutta Copies, are spurious; such <i>Rubáiyát</i>
being the common form of Epigram in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
Persia. But this, at best, tells as much one way as
another; nay, the Súfi, who may be considered the
Scholar and Men of Letters in Persia, would be far
more likely than the careless Epicure to interpolate
what favors his own view of the Poet. I observe
that very few of the more mystical Quatrains are
in the Bodleian MS. which must be one of the
oldest, as dated at Shiraz, <span class="txt90">A.H.</span> 865, <span class="txt90">A.D.</span> 1460. And
this, I think, especially distinguishes Omar (I cannot
help calling him by his&mdash;no, not Christian&mdash;familiar
name) from all other Persian Poets: That,
whereas with them the Poet is lost in his Song, the
Man in Allegory and Abstraction; we seem to have
the Man&mdash;the <i>Bonhomme</i>&mdash;Omar himself, with all
his Humors and Passions, as frankly before us as if
we were really at Table with him, after the Wine
had gone round.</p>

<p>I must say that I, for one, never wholly believed
in the mysticism of Háfiz. It does not appear there
was any danger in holding and singing Súfi Pantheism,
so long as the Poet made his Salaam to
Mohammed at the beginning and end of his Song.
Under such conditions Jeláluddín, Jámí, Attár,
and others sang; using Wine and Beauty indeed as
Images to illustrate, not as a Mask to hide, the
Divinity they were celebrating. Perhaps some
Allegory less liable to mistake or abuse had been
better among so inflammable a People: much more
so when, as some think with Háfiz and Omar, the
abstract is not only likened to, but identified with,
the sensual Image; hazardous, if not to the Devotee
himself, yet to his weaker Brethren; and worse for
the Profane in proportion as the Devotion of the
Initiated grew warmer. And all for what? To be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
tantalized with Images of sensual enjoyment
which must be renounced if one would approximate
a God, who, according to the Doctrine, <i>is</i>
Sensual Matter as well as Spirit, and into whose
Universe one expects unconsciously to merge after
Death, without hope of any posthumous Beatitude
in another world to compensate for all one's self-denial
in this. Lucretius' blind Divinity certainly
merited, and probably got, as much self-sacrifice
as this of the Súfi; and the burden of Omar's Song&mdash;if
not "Let us eat"&mdash;is assuredly&mdash;"Let us drink,
for To-morrow we die!" And if Háfiz meant quite
otherwise by a similar language, he surely miscalculated
when he devoted his Life and Genius to
so equivocal a Psalmody as, from his Day to this,
has been said and sung by any rather than Spiritual
Worshipers.</p>

<p>However, as there is some traditional presumption,
and certainly the opinion of some learned
men, in favor of Omar's being a Súfi&mdash;and even
something of a Saint&mdash;those who please may so
interpret his Wine and Cup-bearer. On the other
hand, as there is far more historical certainty of his
being a Philosopher, of scientific Insight and
Ability far beyond that of the Age and Country
he lived in; of such moderate worldly Ambition as
becomes a Philosopher, and such moderate wants
as rarely satisfy a Debauchee; other readers may be
content to believe with me that, while the Wine
Omar celebrates is simply the Juice of the Grape,
he bragged more than he drank of it, in very defiance
perhaps of that Spiritual Wine which left its
Votaries sunk in Hypocrisy or Disgust.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
